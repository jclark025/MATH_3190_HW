# Question 1

```{r}
##plot poisson pmf
ggplot(data.frame(x=c(1:10)), aes(x)) +
    geom_point(aes(y=dpois(x, 5))) + labs(y = "density")

##plot manually
ggplot(data.frame(x=c(1:10)), aes(x)) +
    geom_point(aes(y=(5^x*exp(-5))/(factorial(x)) )) + labs(y = "density")


```

## Question 1 images

```{r label, out.width = "85%", out.height="100%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/James/OneDrive/School/MATH_3190/HW_5_1.pdf")
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/James/OneDrive/School/MATH_3190/HW_5_1d.pdf")

```
# Question 2

```{r}
##plot pmf theta = 0.5
ggplot(data.frame(x=seq(0,1, by = 0.1)), aes(x)) +
    geom_point(aes(y=(0.5*x^(0.5-1)) )) + labs(y = "density")

## theta = 5
ggplot(data.frame(x=seq(0,1, by = 0.1)), aes(x)) +
    geom_point(aes(y=(5*x^(5-1)) )) + labs(y = "density")


```

## Question 2 image

```{r label2, out.width = "85%", out.height="100%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/James/OneDrive/School/MATH_3190/HW_5_2.pdf")
```

**Limit of pdf when approaching infinity equals infinity, so MLE may not be maximum

# Question 3

## Question 3 image


```{r label3, out.width = "85%", out.height="100%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/James/OneDrive/School/MATH_3190/HW_5_3.pdf")
```

The MLE is the sum of squares. This is to be expected because that is what sigma is typically regarded as.
